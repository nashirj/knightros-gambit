      <div id="intro">Project Summary</div>
      <div id="text"><i>Knightr0's Gambit</i> is a partnership between the UCF student chapter of the Institute of Electrical 
        and Electronics Engineers (<a href = "https://ieee.cecs.ucf.edu" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">UCF IEEE</a>)
         the UCF Artificial Intelligence club (<a  href="https://ucfai.org" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">UCF AI</a>) 
         to create an automatic chessboard (similar to <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3cjWc-XXCg" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');
         return false;">Harry Potter's Wizard Chess</a> with less violence) powered by a custom chess AI. We plan to use computer vision to 
         detect the board state after each move (see <a href="software.html#computerVision">Computer Vision</a>), build in natural language 
         processing capabilities to allow moving a piece without touching the board (see <a href="software.html#speechRecognition">Speech 
           Recognition</a>), and we plan to build a web application to allow displaying the current game state as well as playing against 
           the chess board through a smartphone or computer interface (see <a href="software.html#webApp">Web Application</a>).</div>
      <div id="background">Background and Motivation</div>
      <div id="text">Chess and artificial intelligence have been closely related since the dawn of AI research 
        (<a  href="https://www.history.com/news/in-1950-alan-turing-created-a-chess-computer-program-that-prefigured-a-i" 
        onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">Turing</a>). The state of the art for chess engines is constantly evolving, 
        but recent advancements include <a  href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go" 
        onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">AlphaZero</a>, which uses reinforcement learning and self-play, and <a  
        href="https://maiachess.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">Maia Chess</a>, which uses supervised learning. We 
        aim to develop a custom chess AI inspired by AlphaZero and Maia that will incorporate machine learning and deep neural networks to 
        develop an understanding of the game of chess. For context, machine learning is a data-driven artificial intelligence methodology 
        and is generally divided into three categories: supervised, unsupervised (or self-supervised), and reinforcement learning. We plan 
        to primarily use reinforcement learning to develop our chess AI, but are also considering using supervised learning to improve the 
        AI by learning from high-level human chess games.</div>
      <div id="text">We are particularly inspired by 1) the Raspberry Turk project, which in turn was inspired by the famed <a  
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">Mechanical Turk</a>, a 
        chess automaton (later proven to be a hoax) that was built in the 1770s and 2) the <a  
        href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wondersubstance/phantom-the-most-advanced-chess-board-in-the-world" 
        onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">Phantom</a> chess project, which in turn was inspired by the <a  
        href="https://squareoffnow.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">Square Off</a> chess board. There are many 
        <a  href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/maguerero/automated-chess-board-50ca0f" onclick="window.open(this.href,'');return false;">
          examples</a> of other similar projects, but we believe our approach is novel in combining and refining the following features:
      </div>
      <ul class="a">
        <li>We create an x-y Cartesian coordinate system for the board space, and use two servo motors to actuate the slide rails</li>
        <li>We use computer vision to detect the board state (using traditional computer vision approaches in addition to neural-network 
          based classifiers)</li>
        <li>We develop a custom AI using reinforcement learning and neural networks, akin to AlphaZero</li>
        <li>We enable the capability to play against our custom AI, Maia, Stockfish, and other human opponents (through our custom web app)</li>
        <li>We allow players to move pieces on the physical chessboard using only their voice</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="text">In addition to the clear goal of pushing forward the state of the art for automatic chess boards and chess AI, a secondary 
        goal is one closely tied to the UCF IEEE and UCF AI mission statement: giving undergraduate students opportunities to apply concepts 
        from the classroom in a project-based environment.</div>
